Our thinking process isn't linear but most of the note taking tools _coerce_ you into structuring your notes in a hierarchical form. Zettelkasten takes a completely different approach: There's no strict hierarchy and any note can be "linked" to another note. Think of it like your **second brain**.

A connection can be created in a note using `[[slug]]` syntax. The slug of the markdown file is replaced with the link to the note and a "connection" is established between these 2 notes. 

In the graph UI terminology, the 2 notes act as the **vertex** of the graph connected by an **edge**.
