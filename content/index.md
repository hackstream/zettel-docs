`zettel` is a simple FOSS tool to jot down notes using Zettelkasten methodology. The core aim of `zettel` is to store notes _for life_. The notes are in simple `markdown` format which can be published as a static website. (For eg this site you are currently on is generated by `zettel`!)

## Features

- Generate static website using `zettel build`.
- No external dependency of any app or SASS vendor lock in for your notes. `zettel` operates on plain markdown files.
- Generate **Connections** between notes with a simple syntax.
- Visualise all the connections with a Graph UI.
- No `$EDITOR` or Electron JS dependencies. The markdown notes work the same everywhere!
- `zettel` is a single binary. Easy to setup and get started in minutes!
