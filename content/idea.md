We believe note taking is a something that should not be locked in to a particular proprietary format or a SAAS app. You should _own_ your data for life! Sadly the tools these days make it extremely hard for your notes to move around and also lock you in their own proprietary ecosystem.

With Zettel you are not locked into any SAAS app or a custom file format. You don't have to trust this tool to last forever - for your data to outlast you.
`zettel` uses the notes from local disk and generates connections out of it which can be published as a static webpage.
